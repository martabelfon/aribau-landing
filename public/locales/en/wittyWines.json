    "description-1": "WITTY WINES proposes an innovative approach to winemaking, reversing the traditional process. Instead of starting in the vineyard, it begins with the consumer's palate, identifying the desired flavors and aromas. From there, they create an image that reflects those characteristics, also establishing the product's economic profile. They then seek out the right winemaker and the ideal terroir to produce the wine. The project seeks to offer freshness, dynamism, and creativity, proposing an experience that complements the gastronomic offering and builds consumer loyalty with original, high-quality ideas.",
